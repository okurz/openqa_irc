# openqa_irc

IRC bot for openQA in perl

So for this is a play around tool for me to learn some perl and help with
openQA, nothing especially fancy or interesting.


## Usage

* Install requirements

    cpanm .


* Call the script

    perl openqa_irc


* Talk to the bot, e.g. say "!help"


* By default the bot starts in "development mode". For a productive instance
  it is recommended to provide a configuration file, see instructions in
  `openqa_irc` itself.
